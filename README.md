## Technology
Site was created using a SANE stack. Images hosted on AWS and cataloged in a Postgres SQL database. Currently working on giving the user the ability to upload images to AWS for self suficent use.
A lot of attention was given to load time as the images are quite larege and detailed. Created 3 versions of each image using photoshop to increase the load time and allow for a smooth transistion between pages.
The mouse over zoom effect was created using ElevateZoom, a free plug in.
Sending an email to the owner is done through the server and links into their gmail account.

## Other
Site is still in production, working on making the site mobile responsive. Other fixes and improvements coming.
